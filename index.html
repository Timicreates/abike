         Yoo,
           My love , this may seem weird (lol), i just felt like showing how much i love you and miss you......
           These past days that we've seen each other made me realize how much i really miss you . and in a matter of weeks, you'll go back to school and it will be a while before we see each other...
           Do i wish you school in lagos ? of course .. But you have to chase your dreams ... i love you more than words can describe and i wish we could see each other every day...

           Anytime you miss me , you can just come back here and check through this message.



           <h2>I LOVE YOU</h2>

              <p class=" writeup"> The sparkle in your eye,
The warmth of your skin,
Your breath on my neck
That shakes me within.

The beauty of your kiss,
And that magic in your touch.
It is for all these reasons and more
Why I love you so much...

              <p class="writeup">It makes me happy just being by your side.
All these feelings I just can't hide.
You'll always be in my heart.
Can't bear the pain when we are apart.
Nobody is as special as you are to me.
I hope you are beginning to see
Just how much I care for you,

before the sun rises,
when in the still of the darkness
my heart feels your presence.
Your love, your tenderness,
your slow rhythmic breathing as you sleep,
and I am at peace.

You are never far from my heart.
I loved you then,
I love you now.
It's always when
And never how.
Take me back to yesterday,
All the wonderful things you had to say.
I loved you then,
I love you now.
It's always when
And never how.
I see your eyes,
I feel you near,
Although you're not
Really here.

<h2 class="testimonial-text">You were like the sun who brought light
Into my cold, dark, and lifeless night.
You made me realize that no matter what I do,
My life will always revolve around you.

Just when I thought that darkness was all around,
You showed me your light and picked me up off the ground.
In your arms, love and care is what I found.
With you, peace and ease surrounds.

We are like the sun and the moon.
Far in every way, but I wish to see you soon.
We are miles and miles apart,
But never forget we are always connected in our heart.
